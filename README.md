## Overview

This Student Information System demonstrates full-stack development capabilities with a focus on database design, RESTful API architecture, and modern frontend development. The system manages the complete academic lifecycle including course registration, enrollment processing, grade management, and academic records.

## Key Features

### 🎓 Student Portal

- **Academic Calendar Integration**: View terms, deadlines, and important dates
- **Grade Tracking**: GPA calculation, transcripts, and academic progress monitoring
- **Course Search & Discovery**: Advanced filtering by department, term, and prerequisites
- **Shopping Cart System**: Add/drop courses with instant validation

### 👨‍🏫 Faculty Portal
- **Course Management**: View assigned courses and student rosters
- **Grade Submission**: Submit and manage student grades with approval workflow
- **Course Analytics**: Track enrollment and student performance

### 🔧 Admin Portal
- **User Management**: Create and manage student, faculty, and admin accounts
- **Enrollment Oversight**: Approve late enrollments and course changes
- **System Reports**: Generate enrollment statistics and academic analytics
- **Course Catalog Management**: Maintain course offerings, schedules, and prerequisites

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 19** with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Vite** for fast builds and hot module replacement
- **TailwindCSS** for responsive, modern UI design
- **TanStack Query** for efficient server state management
- **React Router v7** for client-side routing
- **Axios** for HTTP requests

### Backend
- **Node.js 18+** runtime environment
- **Express.js** web framework with TypeScript
- **Prisma ORM** for type-safe database access
- **PostgreSQL** relational database
- **Redis** for caching and queue management
- **Bull** for background job processing
- **JWT** authentication with bcrypt password hashing

### Architecture Highlights
- **Queue-Based Enrollment**: Asynchronous processing prevents race conditions
- **Conflict Detection**: Real-time validation of schedule conflicts and prerequisites
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Separate interfaces for students, faculty, and administrators
- **RESTful API Design**: Clean, resource-based API architecture
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment with Docker Compose

**Key Design Patterns:**
- Queue-based asynchronous enrollment processing
- Transaction management for data consistency
- Connection pooling for database optimization
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed data

## Database Schema

The system uses a comprehensive PostgreSQL schema managed by Prisma ORM:

- **users** - Student, faculty, and admin accounts with role-based access
- **courses** - Course catalog with schedules, prerequisites, and capacity tracking
- **enrollments** - Student course enrollments with approval workflows
- **grades** - Academic performance tracking with GPA calculations
- **programs** - Academic programs and major requirements
- **academic_events** - Calendar events and important dates
- **applications** - Student applications for major changes, withdrawals, etc.

## API Documentation

The backend exposes a RESTful API with comprehensive endpoints for:
- Authentication and authorization
- Course management and search
- Enrollment operations
- Grade submission and retrieval
- User and admin management

See [API Documentation](docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md) for detailed endpoint specifications.

## Quick Start

## Technical Highlights

### Queue-Based Enrollment System
Implements Bull (Redis-based queue) for processing enrollment requests asynchronously, ensuring:
- Prevention of race conditions during concurrent enrollments
- FIFO (First In, First Out) processing
- Automatic retry logic for failed operations
- Real-time status tracking

### Conflict Detection Engine
Automatically validates:
- Schedule conflicts (overlapping class times)
- Prerequisite requirements
- Credit limit violations
- Duplicate enrollments

### Performance Optimizations
- Database query optimization with strategic indexing
- Connection pooling for efficient database access
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Pagination for large datasets
- Eager loading of related entities
